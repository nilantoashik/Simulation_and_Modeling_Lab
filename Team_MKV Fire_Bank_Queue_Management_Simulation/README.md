## 📌 Project Overview

The **Bank Queue Management Simulation** models customer arrival and service operations in a bank using queue simulation techniques. Customers enter the bank randomly, wait in queues, and receive services based on system availability.  
This simulation helps understand:

- Queue behaviors  
- Waiting time prediction  
- Service efficiency  
- Resource utilization (counters, tellers)

The project is developed in **Python** using **SimPy**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib**.

## 🎯 Objectives

- To simulate bank queue operations using discrete event simulation.
- To analyze waiting times and queue lengths.
- To visualize real-time queue management behavior.
- To measure service performance with multiple service counters.
