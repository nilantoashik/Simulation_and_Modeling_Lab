        "\n",
        "*   **Simulation Design and Objectives:** The simulation was designed to optimize resource allocation, improve customer experience, evaluate system performance, and support decision-making in a bank queue management system. It employs a Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) approach and tracks key performance metrics such as average waiting time, teller utilization, and queue length.\n",
        "*   **Core Logic Implementation:** The foundational components for a discrete-event simulation were successfully implemented in Python, including `Event`, `EventQueue`, and `Simulation` classes, establishing the event-driven mechanism.\n",
        "*   **Bank Entities Implementation:** Python classes for `Customer`, `Teller`, and `Queue` were developed, complete with attributes and behaviors essential for modeling their interactions within the bank environment.\n",
        "*   **Random Processes:** Functions were implemented to simulate customer inter-arrival times using an exponential distribution and service times using normal or uniform distributions, introducing stochasticity crucial for realistic simulation.\n",
        "*   **Performance Monitoring:** The simulation effectively collects critical performance metrics, including detailed customer records (waiting time, system time), queue length history, and teller status history.\n",
        "*   **Simulation Validation:**\n",
        "    *   **Scenario 1 (2 Tellers, 1 Queue):** Demonstrated efficient operation with 8 customers served, an average waiting time of 0.33, an average system time of 7.89, and teller utilizations around 48-53%. The maximum queue length observed was 1.\n",
        "    *   **Scenario 2 (1 Teller, 2 Queues):** Revealed bottlenecks with increased waiting times (average of 17.16) and system times (average of 25.41), and high teller utilization (Teller 0 at 110.03%, implying continuous busyness beyond simulation duration). Only 8 out of 12 arrived customers were served, with a maximum queue length of 3.\n",
        "    *   **Scenario 3 (High Arrival Rate, Low Service Rate):** Illustrated system saturation, serving only 6 out of 26 arrived customers, leading to a high average waiting time of 18.96, an average system time of 28.99, and a maximum queue length of 20. Teller utilization was maxed out at 100.35%.\n",
        "*   **C++ Integration for EventQueue:** The performance-critical `EventQueue` component was successfully reimplemented in C++ and integrated into the Python simulation using `ctypes`. This allowed the core event scheduling to leverage C++'s performance while maintaining the overall simulation logic in Python.\n",
        "*   **Data Analysis and Visualization:** Comprehensive analysis was performed using pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. Visualizations included:\n",
        "    *   A histogram of customer waiting times, showing their distribution.\n",
        "    *   A line plot of total queue length over time, capturing dynamic changes.\n",
        "    *   A bar chart illustrating teller utilization (e.g., Teller 0 at 81.72%, Teller 1 at 76.30% in a specific scenario).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The simulation effectively identified system bottlenecks under different conditions, such as insufficient tellers or high customer arrival rates, leading to increased waiting times and decreased service levels. This directly supports the objective of optimizing resource allocation and improving customer experience.\n",
        "*   Future enhancements could include implementing more complex queuing disciplines (e.g., shortest processing time first), incorporating customer balking or reneging behaviors, and conducting more extensive sensitivity analysis on input parameters (arrival rates, service times) to derive optimal staffing and queue configurations.\n"
